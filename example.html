<h1>Live from the Broadello</h1>

<h3>What the hell is this?</h3>

We'll let the reviews do the talking:
<blockquote><em>"Like shamelessly listening to someone else's conversation in a cafe"</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>"Usually when I listen to podcasts, I get distracted and don't do my work. Your podcast is great - it's boring enough that I can keep working while listening to it!"</em></blockquote>

<h3>Episode List</h3>

<a href="ep_012.mp3">Episode 12: Was I Just On The Best Podcast?</a> (25:40)<br/>
Our guest this week provides enlightening discourse on turtles, being a pianist, and what it's like to cross the divide from reporting on science to actually making it. And a listener challenge: guess which company is anonymously sponsoring our podcast!
<br/><br/>
<a href="ep_011.mp3">Episode 11: Whales Hate This One Weird Trick</a> (21:09)<br/>
Hussein's BBQ, white collar crime, Angry Programming Things, and what Belgians say when you try to eat them.
<br/><br/>
<a href="ep_010.mp3">Episode 10: Broadelloband</a> (22:13)<br/>
Our tenth episode! That's nine more than we expected. We look to our podcasting future, and then somehow talking about a relationship-building exercise leads us to discussing Mars, our partners abandoning us, and my secret desire to have Audrey Hepburn as my word slave. All while we're very temporally confused.
<br/><br/>
<a href="ep_009.mp3">Episode 9: Forever Is A Very Long Time</a> (19:51)<br/>
Normal service didn't resume on Monday - it resumed on a Guest Wednesday. We immediately rename our guest Phil, and then talk about The Fear you get when you realise it's time to get married pretty soon. Also: watersports and Russian immigrants.
<br/><br/>
<a href="bonus_001.mp3">Bonus Episode 1</a> (05:57)<br/>
After we finished recording Episode 6 we stuck around talking about what it's like to record a podcast. Since Hussein is too busy <del>being irresponsible on a jetski</del> working very hard out of the office and thus unable to record an episode today, we thought we'd let you in on one of our behind-the-scenes after-show chats. Normal service will resume Monday.
<br/><br/>
<a href="ep_008.mp3">Episode 8: Homecoming Coalition Leader</a> (23:58)<br/>
Our guest this week confesses all her misdeeds and a love of Phish, which can only end well given that her boss listens to the podcast. We also talk about hair, Louis' homecoming victory, the Queen of England's voiceover career, and the next social media superstar #puppywilson.
<br/><br/>
<a href="ep_007.mp3">Episode 7: Boats 'n' Jotes</a> (15:13)<br/>
This episode contains our first ever verified funny joke! Then we catch up on a week's worth of Boat Corner, and are abruptly interrupted by someone who wants to use the meeting room.
<br/><br/>
<a href="ep_006.mp3">Episode 6: Fractional Bear</a> (28:14)<br/>
On our second Guest Wednesdays Louis defends his love of Dungeons and Dragons, and Grace explains what it's like to be stuck in the 17th century. Also, Louis slurps really noisily eating a plum in the background for about five minutes, so sorry about that.
<br/><br/>
<a href="ep_005.mp3">Episode 5: Pumparticle Bread</a> (30:15)<br/>
Episode 5 of Live from the Broadello has been specially recorded so that you, dear listener, can be a guest on it! We begin by providing a veritable smörgåsbord of possible reactions to your guest opinions, and then spend an awfully long time discussing sandwiches. Also: two thousand chickens on a motorway, and our rise to internet fame thanks to corporate sponsorship and a huge FBI listenership.
<br/><br/>
<a href="ep_004.mp3">Episode 4: Cool Plague, Bro</a> (26:18)<br/>
It's our first Guest Wednesdays! We wonder if it's too soon to make jokes about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Molasses_Disaster">Boston Molasses Flood</a>, discuss the merits of Olympic deer racing, opinion safewords, and the inherent funniness of ducks. Also, we dissect a joke provided by our guest.
<br/><br/>
<a href="ep_003.mp3">Episode 3: Wholegrain Beetles</a> (17:54)<br/>
This one's a bit slow. We talk about Hussein's DIY Soylent, star locusts, and British Christmas traditions. Also, we verify our first listener-submitted joke!
<br/><br/>
<a href="ep_002.mp3">Episode 2: Time-To-Vomit</a> (23:45)<br/>
In which we discuss the stretch goals for our nonexistent Kickstarter, constructive heckling, why roses are a symbol of the patriarchy, and the awful, terrible idea that is <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10817354/Birdly-Oculus-Rift-simulator-recreates-flying-like-a-bird.html">Birdly</a>. Listeners are encouraged to email or tweet us their favourite joke, which we'll verify as "funny" or "not funny" next episode.
<br/><br/>
<a href="ep_001.mp3">Episode 1: Engineering Ghosts</a> (22:17)<br/>
What happens when a Jew and an Arab walk into Zion? Amongst other things, they discuss the relative sizes of dinosaurs, getting ghosts to deliver your mail, and how to make boats. Plus, a grape-based challenge for our listeners!
